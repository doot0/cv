### Bio
Strong mid-level front-end developer with 8 years experience in a professional capacity. Recently relocated to London with a view to finding a permanent or contract role. 

Highly personable and empathetic individual able to take lead for projects of almost any size/scope. My past placements have allowed me to become extremely good at working with ambiguity and unknowns in a given workplace, with a deep level of understanding across every aspect involved in what it is to build a maintainable, high quality website or web app.

Having contracted for several years I am ready to consider permanent roles.

#### Technical experience overview

Development:
- HTML, CSS, SCSS (excellent)
- JavaScript ES5 & ES6, Node.js, Vue.js (strong)
- PHP, Bash, Webpack, Gulp, Cypress, Jest (basic)

Design:
- Sketch (strong)
- Photoshop (good)
- Illustrator (basic)

#### Current roles

- Frontend Developer, contracting @ [SamKnows](https://samknows.com) *(June 2019 - August 19th 2019)*

First role as a contractor. Acting stand-in for the lead frontend developer for first 4 weeks, then moved to the
platform engineering team. During the first half of my time there I was responsible for cutting the amount of API
requests for the platform by at least 25%, and reducing the size of the overall frontend payload by at least 5%.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Vue.js, Node.js & SCSS
- Backend: PHP
- Infrastructure: GitHub, Apache
- Testing: Cypress, Jest

- CTO @ [Foundlost](https://foundlo.st) _"AirBnb" for extreme outdoor expeditions._ *(April 2019 - Present)*

I handle every single technical aspect at the company - as sole engineer I have built our companies' entire 
infrastructure from the ground up. Our infra costs are absolutely nothing which have allowed us to focus our 
revenues and funding into other parts of the business. 

Our tech stack currently includes the following;
- Frontend: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade)
- Backend: AirTable as a content backend. The application is serverless and thus no "real" backend is needed
- Infrastructure: Netlify, GitHub

#### Past roles

- Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ GraphEQ (now defunct) *(September 2017 - 2018) 1 year*

Borne out of an idea between myself, the CTO, the CEO, and lead designer from my previous role, the role I had here
was another startup role. Here my responsibilities very closely matched the ones at Pathship.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade)
- Backend: Node.js
- Infrastructure: GitHub
- Design: Sketch

- Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ Pathship (previously The Graduate, now defunct) *(October 2015 - April 2017) 1 year, 7 months*

Another startup role, based in education technology. Mostly remote, but around 6 months in total on site in Hong Kong. 
This role was pivotal in helping shape my skill-set into what it is today. Before I was hired at this startup, 
the entire frontend was in a huge state of disarray. After arriving and identifying hundreds of problems with the 
code, I knew it was essentially beyond repair. As a result, the CTO and I binned our entire front-end, and with me on 
board, we rewrote the entire UI in 2 weeks whilst working closely with the lead designer. The resulting frontend was 
massively scalable and maintainable and remained in use for the duration of the company's existence. To quote the the 
co-founders of the company; 
"without Dave on board, the company would have died within 4 weeks".

While here I authored a CSS architecture guide for building hugely scalable and maintainable UI that can be applied 
to any current or future codebase, regardless of the picked technology stacks.

Over time, I became responsible for leading a talented team of 4-5 developers, where I got the chance to exercise
my team management and leadership skills. 

Tech covered:
- Frontend: Angular JS, Angular JS 2, Vue.js, SCSS
- Backend: Node.js
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA
- Design: Sketch

- Remote Frontend Engineer @ Gasket Inc (now defunct) *(November 2014 - April 2015) 6 months*

This was my first role at a startup. Gasket Inc was a company based in San Francisco seeking to create a product similar
to what AirTable is today (think Google Spreadsheets + Zapier in one package). This was the first time I had worked in
an environment 100% remotely but I very quickly adapted to the communication issues that were in my way and was able to
work very well with ambiguity, as well as being under huge amounts of pressure to deliver on time in order to meet 
investor targets. I worked primarily in tandem with one other extremely talented developer who now works for 
(Zeit)[https://zeit.co]. While here I headed up development of my first business-grade SCSS codebase and also helped
refactor from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

Tech covered:
- Frontend: Angular JS, Angular 2, SCSS
- Backend: Python
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA

- Frontend Developer @ [Moore-Wilson New Media Ltd](https://www.m-w.co.uk/) *(September 2014 - November 2014) 3 months*

I was hired here as a frontend developer but was asked to do work outside the scope of my contract. I quickly found 
work elsewhere, where I knew I would be of actual technical use. Regardless of this, it was here I first learned to 
work in a "real" office environment and this helped bolster my communication skills in the short time I was there.

Tech covered:
- Frontend: Angular JS, vanilla JS, SASS
- Backend: Laravel
- Infrastructure: Bitbucket, JIRA
- Design: N/A

--- 

- Front-end Developer @ [Lupimedia Ltd](https://www.lupimedia.com/) *(September 2011 - August 2014) 3 years*

My apprenticeship (and first formal role) was a placement at a small design and development studio based in Dorset.
Though my official title was frontend developer, I covered a huge range of topics at this placement and was able 
to get experience with every aspect of design & development for the web, all the way from discussing an initial 
set of requirements and identifying needs for clients, designing layouts and wire-frames based on our discoveries, 
building the frontend _and_ backend for them, and managing the deployment and infrastructure required. In most 
cases I was also in charge of client liaison and wrote extensive amounts of copy and documentation.

Tech covered:
- Frontend: Angular JS, Dojo, MooTools, vanilla JS (ES5), SASS/SCSS, LESS
- Backend: Zend Framework, Laravel, vanilla PHP (5.2 - 5.4)
- Infrastructure: nginx, Apache, CentOS, Ubuntu, GitHub, BitBucket, JIRA
- Design: Adobe Fireworks (CS5), Adobe Photoshop (CS5), Adobe Illustrator (CS5)
- Other technologies of note: Drupal, Magento, WordPress, a bespoke in-house CMS (PHP & Dojo/MooTools)
