>CTO + Co-Founder @ [Foundlost](https://foundlo.st) _"AirBnb" for extreme outdoor expeditions._ *(April 2019 - April 2020)*

I handled every single technical aspect at the company - as sole engineer I built the companies' entire 
infrastructure. The infra costs were literally nothing which allowed us to focus revenues and funding 
into other parts of the business.

- Frontend: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade)
- Backend: AirTable as a content backend. The application is serverless and thus no "real" backend is needed
- Infrastructure: Netlify, GitHub

---

>Frontend Developer @ [SamKnows](https://samknows.com) *(June 2019 - August 19th 2019)*

First role as a contractor. Acting stand-in for the lead frontend developer for first 4 weeks, then moved to the
platform engineering team. During the first half of my time there I was responsible for cutting the amount of API
requests for the platform by at least 25%, and reducing the size of the overall frontend payload by at least 5%.

- Backend: PHP
- Infrastructure: GitHub, Apache
- Testing: Cypress, Jest

>Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ GraphEQ (now defunct) *(September 2017 - 2018) 1 year*

Borne out of an idea between myself, the CTO, the CEO, and lead designer from my previous role, the role I had here
was another startup role. Here my responsibilities very closely matched the ones at Pathship.

- Frontend: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade)
- Backend: Node.js
- Infrastructure: GitHub
- Design: Sketch 

--- 

>Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ Pathship (previously The Graduate, now defunct) *(October 2015 - April 2017) 1 year, 7 months*

Startup role. Mostly remote, but around 6 months in total on site in Hong Kong. This role helped shape my 
skill-set into what it is today. After joining, the CTO and I binned the and rewrote it all in 2 weeks. 
While here I authored a CSS architecture guide for building hugely scalable and maintainable UI that can 
be applied to any web codebase which [still holds up to this day](https://github.com/doot0/compago/). I 
eventually became responsible for leading a talented team of 4-5 developers, where I got the chance to 
exercise my team management and leadership skills. 

- Frontend: Angular JS, Angular JS 2, Vue.js, SCSS
- Backend: Node.js
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA
- Design: Sketch

>Remote Frontend Engineer @ Gasket Inc (now defunct) *(November 2014 - April 2015) 6 months*

First role at a startup, first 100% remote role. Gasket Inc was a company based in San Francisco seeking to 
create a product similar to AirTable. I very quickly adapted to the communication issues that were in my way 
and was able to work very well with ambiguity, as well as being under huge amounts of pressure to deliver on 
time in order to meet investor targets. I headed up development of my first business-grade SCSS codebase and 
also helped refactor from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

- Frontend: Angular JS, Angular 2, SCSS
- Backend: Python
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA

>Frontend Developer @ [Moore-Wilson New Media Ltd](https://www.m-w.co.uk/) *(September 2014 - November 2014) 3 months*

I was hired here as a frontend developer but was asked to do work outside the scope of my contract. I quickly found 
work elsewhere, where I knew I would be of actual technical use. Regardless of this, it was here I first learned to 
work in a "real" office environment and this helped bolster my communication skills in the short time I was there.

- Frontend: Angular JS, vanilla JS, SASS
- Backend: Laravel
- Infrastructure: Bitbucket, JIRA
- Design: N/A

--- 

>Front-end Developer @ [Lupimedia Ltd](https://www.lupimedia.com/) *(September 2011 - August 2014) 3 years*

My apprenticeship (and first formal role) was a placement at a small design and development studio based in Dorset.
Though my official title was frontend developer, I covered a huge range of topics at this placement and was able 
to get experience with every aspect of design & development for the web, all the way from discussing an initial 
set of requirements and identifying needs for clients, designing layouts and wire-frames based on our discoveries, 
building the frontend _and_ backend for them, and managing the deployment and infrastructure required. In most 
cases I was also in charge of client liaison and wrote extensive amounts of copy and documentation.

- Frontend: Angular JS, Dojo, MooTools, vanilla JS (ES5), SASS/SCSS, LESS
- Backend: Zend Framework, Laravel, vanilla PHP (5.2 - 5.4)
- Infrastructure: nginx, Apache, CentOS, Ubuntu, GitHub, BitBucket, JIRA
- Design: Adobe Fireworks (CS5), Adobe Photoshop (CS5), Adobe Illustrator (CS5)
- Other technologies of note: Drupal, Magento, WordPress, a bespoke in-house CMS (PHP & Dojo/MooTools)
