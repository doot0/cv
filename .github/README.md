Acted as stand-in for the lead frontend developer for first 4 weeks, then moved to the platform engineering team.

Tech: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade), Node.js, GitHub, Sketch 

This role closesly matches the prior one at Pathship, as I worked with ex co-workers from Pathship after it was shuttered.

Tech: Angular JS, Angular JS 2, Vue.js, SCSS, Node.js, GitHub, JIRA, Sketch

Startup role. Mostly remote, but 6+ months on site in Hong Kong. After joining, the CTO and I binned years of poorly authored frontend and rewrote it in 2 weeks. While here I authored a CSS architecture guide for building hugely scalable and maintainable UI that can be applied to any web codebase which [still holds up to this day](https://github.com/doot0/compago/). I became responsible for leading a talented team of 4-5 developers, where I grew my team management and leadership skills.

>Remote Frontend Engineer @ Gasket Inc (now defunct) *(November 2014 - April 2015) 6 months*

Tech: Angular JS, Angular 2, SCSS, Python, GitHub, JIRA

First startup & remote role. Gasket Inc was a company based in San Francisco seeking to create a product similar to AirTable. I quickly adapted to the asynchronous work style and worked very well with ambiguity and pressure to deliver. I developed my first business-grade SCSS codebase and also helped refactor from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

Tech: Angular JS, vanilla JS, SASS. Laravel, Bitbucket, JIRA

Hired as a frontend developer but was tasked with work outside of my contract scope, which is why my tenure here was short (I left). It was here I first learned to work in a "real" office environment and this bolstered my communication skills in the short time I was there.

>Front-end Developer @ [Lupimedia Ltd](https://www.lupimedia.com/) *(September 2011 - August 2014) 3 years*

Apprenticeship at a small design and development studio, where I built experience with all aspects of design & development for the web. These included identifying requirements for clients and supporting them, designing layouts and wire-frames based on our discoveries, building the frontend _and_ backend for them, and managing the deployment and infrastructure required. I was also often in charge of client liaison and wrote extensive amounts of copy and documentation.
