watching educational content concerning applied mathematics/cryptography, web3, and macro-economics.

>Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ GraphEQ (now defunct) *(September 2017 - 2018) 1 year*

Pathship after it was shuttered.

>Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ Pathship (now defunct) *(October 2015 - April 2017) 1 year, 7 months*

Startup role. Mostly remote, but 6+ months on site in Hong Kong. After joining, the CTO and I binned 
years of frontend and rewrote it in 2 weeks. While here I authored a CSS architecture guide for 
building hugely scalable and maintainable UI that can be applied to any web codebase which 
[still holds up to this day](https://github.com/doot0/compago/). I eventually became responsible 
for leading a talented team of 4-5 developers, where I got the chance to exercise my team 
management and leadership skills.

>Remote Frontend Engineer @ Gasket Inc (now defunct) *(November 2014 - April 2015) 6 months*

First startup & remote role. Gasket Inc was a company based in San Francisco seeking to create a 
product similar to AirTable. I very quickly adapted to the communication issues that were in my way and 
was able to work very well with ambiguity, as well as being under huge amounts of pressure to deliver on 
time in order to meet investor targets. I headed up development of my first business-grade SCSS codebase
and also helped refactor from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

- Frontend: Angular JS, Angular 2, SCSS
- Backend: Python
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA

>Frontend Developer @ [Moore-Wilson New Media Ltd](https://www.m-w.co.uk/) *(September 2014 - November 2014) 3 months*

Hired as a frontend developer but was made to do work that was outside of my contract scope, which is why my tenure here 
was short (I left). Regardless of this, it was here I first learned to work in a "real" office environment and this helped 
bolster my communication skills in the short time I was there.

- Frontend: Angular JS, vanilla JS, SASS
- Backend: Laravel
- Infrastructure: Bitbucket, JIRA
- Design: N/A

--- 

>Front-end Developer @ [Lupimedia Ltd](https://www.lupimedia.com/) *(September 2011 - August 2014) 3 years*

Apprenticeship (and first formal role) at a small design and development studio based in Dorset. I was 
responsibile for a huge range of topics at this placement and built experience with all aspects of design & 
development for the web. Some of these includes identifying requirements for clients and supporting them, designing 
layouts and wire-frames based on our discoveries, building the frontend _and_ backend for them, and managing the 
deployment and infrastructure required. I was also typically in charge of client liaison and wrote extensive 
amounts of copy and documentation.

- Frontend: Angular JS, Dojo, MooTools, vanilla JS (ES5), SASS/SCSS, LESS
- Backend: Zend Framework, Laravel, vanilla PHP (5.2 - 5.4)
- Infrastructure: nginx, Apache, CentOS, Ubuntu, GitHub, BitBucket, JIRA
- Design: Adobe Fireworks (CS5), Adobe Photoshop (CS5), Adobe Illustrator (CS5)
- Other technologies of note: Drupal, Magento, WordPress, a bespoke in-house CMS (PHP & Dojo/MooTools)
