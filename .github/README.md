- Backend: AirTable as a content backend. The application was serverless and thus required no backend
- Infrastructure: Netlify, GitHub

Acted as stand-in for the lead frontend developer for first 4 weeks, then moved to the platform engineering team.

>Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ GraphEQ (now defunct) *(September 2017 - 2018) 1 year*

- Backend: Node.js
- Infrastructure: GitHub
- Design: Sketch 

---

>Lead Frontend Developer & UI Architect @ Pathship (now defunct) *(October 2015 - April 2017) 1 year, 7 months*

Startup role. Mostly remote, but 6+ months on site in Hong Kong. After joining, the CTO and I binned years of poorly authored frontend and rewrote it in 2 weeks. While here I authored a CSS architecture guide for building hugely scalable and maintainable UI that can be applied to any web codebase which [still holds up to this day](https://github.com/doot0/compago/). I became responsible for leading a talented team of 4-5 developers, where I grew my team management and leadership skills.

- Backend: Node.js
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA
- Design: Sketch

>Remote Frontend Engineer @ Gasket Inc (now defunct) *(November 2014 - April 2015) 6 months*

First startup & remote role. Gasket Inc was a company based in San Francisco seeking to create a product similar to AirTable. I quickly adapted to the asynchronous work style and worked very well with ambiguity and pressure to deliver. I developed my first business-grade SCSS codebase and also helped refactor from Angular 1 to Angular 2.

- Frontend: Angular JS, Angular 2, SCSS
- Backend: Python
- Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA

---

>Frontend Developer @ [Moore-Wilson New Media Ltd](https://www.m-w.co.uk/) *(September 2014 - November 2014) 3 months*

Hired as a frontend developer but was tasked with work outside of my contract scope, which is why my tenure here was short (I left). It was here I first learned to work in a "real" office environment and this bolstered my communication skills in the short time I was there.

- Frontend: Angular JS, vanilla JS, SASS
- Backend: Laravel
- Infrastructure: Bitbucket, JIRA

---

>Front-end Developer @ [Lupimedia Ltd](https://www.lupimedia.com/) *(September 2011 - August 2014) 3 years*

Apprenticeship at a small design and development studio, where I built experience with all aspects of design & development for the web. These included identifying requirements for clients and supporting them, designing layouts and wire-frames based on our discoveries, building the frontend _and_ backend for them, and managing the deployment and infrastructure required. I was also often in charge of client liaison and wrote extensive amounts of copy and documentation.

- Frontend: Angular JS, Dojo, MooTools, vanilla JS (ES5), SASS/SCSS, LESS
- Backend: Zend Framework, Laravel, vanilla PHP (5.2 - 5.4)
- Infrastructure: nginx, Apache, CentOS, Ubuntu, GitHub, BitBucket, JIRA
- Design: Adobe Fireworks (CS5), Adobe Photoshop (CS5), Adobe Illustrator (CS5)
- Other technologies of note: Drupal, Magento, WordPress, a bespoke in-house CMS (PHP & Dojo/MooTools)
