The infra costs were absolutely nothing which allowed us to focus our revenues and funding into other parts of the business.</p> <p>Tech stack:</p> <ul> <li>Frontend: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade)</li> <li>Backend: AirTable as a content backend.

<br><ul> <li>Frontend Developer @ <a href="https://samknows.com">SamKnows</a> <em>(June 2019 - August 19th 2019)</em></li> </ul> <p>First role as a contractor. Acting stand-in for the lead frontend developer for first 4 weeks, then moved to the platform engineering team. During the first half of my time there I was responsible for cutting the amount of API requests for the platform by at least 25%, and reducing the size of the overall frontend payload by at least 5%.</p> <p>Tech stack:</p> <ul> <li>Frontend: Vue.js, Node.js &amp; SCSS</li> <li>Backend: PHP</li> <li>Infrastructure: GitHub, Apache</li> <li>Testing: Cypress, Jest</li> </ul> <hr> <ul> <li>Lead Frontend Developer &amp; UI Architect @ GraphEQ (now defunct) <em>(September 2017 - 2018) 1 year</em></li> </ul> <p>Borne out of an idea between myself, the CTO, the CEO, and lead designer from my previous role, the role I had here was another startup role. Here my responsibilities very closely matched the ones at Pathship.</p> <p>Tech stack:</p> <ul> <li><p>Frontend: Vue.js, SCSS, Pug (formerly Jade)</p></li> <li><p>Backend: Node.js</p></li> <li><p>Infrastructure: GitHub</p></li> <li><p>Design: Sketch</p></li>

<hr><ul><li>Lead Frontend Developer &amp; UI Architect @ Pathship (previously The Graduate, now defunct)&nbsp;<em>(October 2015 - April 2017) 1 year, 7 months</em></li></ul><p>Another startup role, based in education technology. Mostly remote, but around 6 months in total on site in Hong Kong. This role was pivotal in helping shape my skill-set into what it is today. While here I authored a CSS architecture guide for building hugely scalable and maintainable UI that can be applied to any current or future codebase, regardless of the picked technology stacks. Over time, I became responsible for leading a talented team of 4-5 developers, where I got the chance to exercise my team management and leadership skills.</p>
<p>Tech covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frontend: Angular JS, Angular JS 2, Vue.js, SCSS</li>
<li>Backend: Node.js</li>
<li>Infrastructure: GitHub, JIRA</li>

<li>Remote Frontend Engineer @ Gasket Inc (now defunct) <em>(November 2014 - April 2015) 6 months</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This was my first role at a startup. Gasket Inc was a company based in San Francisco seeking to create a product similar to what AirTable is today. While here I headed up development of my first business-grade SCSS codebase and also helped refactor from Angular 1 to Angular 2.</p>
